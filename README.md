Portfolio website of Reuben Reyes: Developer, mechatronics engineer, software engineer.

## About:
I’m a recently graduated Mechanical Engineer with a passion for programming, computer science, and software development.  My concentration in Mechatronics has given me ample experience in the concurrent engineering design process through diverse projects. I’ve learned how to approach problems from many perspectives to find the best solution. I’ve relentlessly scoured software libraries in an effort to arrive at final product that was not only functional, but polished, responsive, and robust. This drive has led me to individually pursue web and game development, learning many tools along the way.
